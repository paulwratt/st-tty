ST-TTY
======

A fast VT52 terminal emulator for a Atari ST with monochrome monitor.

Use it as a serial terminal for you Linux / BSD / whatever server by
connecting it with a null modem cable.  I wrote this emulator because
the VT52 emulator supplied with the ST can't keep up with the maximum
(19200) baudrate of the ST.

The code is written for the MetaComCo Macro Assembler.
